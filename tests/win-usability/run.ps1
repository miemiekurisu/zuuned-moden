# Windows usability gate for Zuuned.
#
#   powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tests\win-usability\run.ps1
#
# Answers one question with evidence: is this Windows build actually usable?  It
# is the GUI equivalent of tests/win-compat: no device, no sound (ZUUNED_MPV_AO is
# the null driver) and no contact with the real profile, because every launch gets
# its own ZUUNED_PROFILE_DIR plus its own ZUUNED_LOCK_SUFFIX and the run compares
# the real profile before and after.  It needs no network to pass, and it does not
# get there by hoping the defaults are quiet: both online questions - album cover
# lookup and artist portrait lookup - ship off, so a seeded case writes no ini at
# all and the music page case asserts the app's own "online lookup off" line plus
# that no provider request line appears.  That assertion is therefore about the
# shipping defaults and not about a value the harness typed in for itself, which
# is the whole point of it: a gate that silences the app and then measures the
# silence proves nothing but the gate.  (With Settings -> Library switched on a
# launch whose seeded library lacks covers does reach a provider; that is the
# user's choice, not the gate's.)
#
# A started process is not proof of anything on Windows: a Qt Quick window can
# come up with a clean stderr and paint nothing.  So each case ends with a
# winshot capture of the live window, and the app itself reports what it decided
# to show through `--qa-probe`, which is what lets the gate say that --page took
# effect instead of inferring it from a screenshot.
#
# Needs a built build\zuuned.exe (and librarytool, transcodetool, playertool) and
# the MSVC x64 environment for winshot, loaded from msvc-env.ps1 when cl is not
# already on PATH.  Nothing in this gate opens a USB device handle, so it certifies
# the UI, the tools and the profile - never the wire.  The Windows wire evidence is
# the hand test recorded in docs\WINDOWS_PORT.md: one Pavo Zune HD, authenticated,
# browsed, sent music, photos and video, and read the music back byte for byte -
# a photo and a video have been re-listed on the player, never read off it.
# Nothing here adds to that, and no run of this gate has ever opened a device.

# renames the window: GetWindowRect then fails on a handle that exists.  Parsing
