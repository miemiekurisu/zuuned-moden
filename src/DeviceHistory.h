// Which players this machine has actually talked to.
//
// Settings -> Device used to answer "no device connected" and nothing else, so
// a user who plugs in a second player, or who reconnects after a driver change,
// could not tell whether the app was looking at the same hardware as last time.
// libzune exposes no firmware version (zune.h has zune_get_serial and no
// firmware call), so a row is name + model + family + capacity + serial and the
// two dates - no firmware field is invented here.
//
// The file lives beside syncqueue.json in the profile's data folder, which is
// what ProfilePaths::writableLocation(AppDataLocation) names, so an isolated
// test profile gets its own history and a run that means to leave the real
// profile alone really does.
//
// One row per device, keyed by serial and falling back to model + name when a
// player answers no serial.  `connects` counts sessions in this process, not
// reconnect attempts: a finished sync arms a reconnect ladder whose rungs are
// each a full OpenSession, and counting those would report a player as handled
// a dozen times because one sync needed six probes.
