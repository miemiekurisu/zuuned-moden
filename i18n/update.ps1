# Regenerate i18n/zuuned_zh_CN.ts from the sources that carry translatable text.
#
#   powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File i18n\update.ps1
#
# lupdate refreshes the <source> strings and keeps every <translation> it can
# match, so the Chinese written by hand survives; strings that disappeared come
# back marked obsolete and -no-obsolete drops them.  The Chinese itself is
# written by hand (or with build/art5/ts_fill.py against a map file), never
# machine-generated: see docs/I18N.md for what is and is not covered.
#
# The list below IS the coverage claim.  C++ wording joins this list only when it
# leaves through UiText::tr() (src/UiText.h), which lupdate extracts under the
# fixed context UiText and the runtime looks up the same way; a bare QStringLiteral
# or QString::fromUtf8 sentence here would be invisible to translation.  A page added here without a translation
# shipped for it is a page that lies about being Chinese.
#
# After this runs, configure/build compiles the .ts into the :/i18n resource
# prefix.  Do not commit the .qm that lrelease or CMake produces.
